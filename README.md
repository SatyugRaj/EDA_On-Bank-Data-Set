# EDA_On-Bank-Data-Set

Through this case study I have tried to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used by the bank for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan,etc. 
This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. 
I have used a bank Data set having Information of Client at time of application and information about previous loans.

In business terms the bank wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The bank can utilise this EDA for its portfolio and risk assessment.
